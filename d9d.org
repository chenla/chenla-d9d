* Introduction

All infrastructure services in Chenla will be provided as
/in-house/, /community/, and /public/ facing services.  The
idea originally came from Amazon's Jeff Bezos.  The idea is
that if your in-house infrastructure competes in the open
market with companies who provide these services as a core
part of their business, you will have to maintain an
infrastructure that is at least as good as theirs or you
will go out of business.  This approach ensures that your
infrastructure doesn't suffer from neglect and bitrot over
time, which is often the case in large companies.
